# DatingRestaurant
 
Users when entering the app will see slogans to welcome new users and blessings for couples. 
They will then be taken to the Home screen, where they can see a list of restaurants. In this list, I curated 20 restaurants that I think are the best for a date. These restaurants can satisfy the taste needs of many diners with tastes from many countries: Thai, European, Nordic, American, Mexican, and Vietnamese. 
In addition, users can also use the search function at the top of the Home screen to find the restaurant name they want. Next, they can select the restaurant to see detailed information such as location, description, contact email, and phone number. 
To save display space, I use the “See more” and “Less” buttons to collapse the content of the description. Users can click to expand the content and collapse with just one button. 
Furthermore, users can click on the “Book table” button to be able to reserve a table at that restaurant. The next screen will ask the user to fill out a form to reserve a table. After filling in all the information, the user can click 
“Submit.” The screen will notify that the reservation has been successful, and the user can return to the Home screen.
